Problems Encountered:

- when implementing CRUD functionality it was difficult designing these features in HTML and CSS with the user experience in mind
- when deploying my project I was not able to deply this project to heroku because it was first deployed via github.io which conflicted with heroku
- I encountered a problem with heroku that did not allow my app to behosted live, I used the wrong config var on heroku which created problems with heroku locating the correct server for my project
