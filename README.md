Unsolved Problems:
- I depoled my project on github.io and that created problems when I tried to push to heroku, so I hat to make a new repository on my github account thus losing my 30 + commits. But this did allow me to host my project on heroku

- There are a few design issues and user expreience issues the hardest thing for me was understanding the how this CRUD format can be implemented in a cool way with the design

- Understand what should I attack first. The Design, the HTML elements, Css elements, CRUD, ect

- there was a problem with heroku, I used the wrong config var on heroku which created problems with heroku locating the server for my project

- develop a social media page where people can share their expreiences at these resturants
- develop a place for people to leave reviews and ratings
